Heart disease and stroke can be fatal, but they can also cause major sickness, disability, and a reduction in life quality. A stroke can result in substantial handicap, including paralysis, speech problems, and emotional issues. 
Individuals who have had a heart attack usually experience exhaustion and despair, and they may find it difficult to engage in physical activity. Heart disease and stroke are two of the most common and costly health concerns worldwide today. 
On a personal level, families dealing with heart disease or stroke face not just medical expenditures, but also missed wages and the possibility of a lower standard of life. Heart disease kills roughly the same number of people each year as cancer, lower respiratory diseases (including pneumonia), and accidents combined. Heart disease and stroke cost the nation an estimated $316.6 billion in health care costs and lost productivity in 2011. Healthcare companies collect a lot of historical data pertaining to these chronic diseases. These datasets can be leveraged to train machine learning algorithms and learn from the history which eventually will help in predicting such chronic conditions in patients. In this dataset, we have a few attributes that helps in prediction: Depending on such attributes, the algorithm gets trained to predict whether or not a given individual has the chances to get some heart disease.
