Linear Discriminant Analysis and Principal Component Analysis is an unsupervised learning algorithm that is used for the dimensionality reduction in machine learning. It is a statistical process that converts the observations of correlated features into a set of 
linearly uncorrelated features with the help of orthogonal transformation.
